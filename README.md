## Bacterial genome assembly and decontamination

*Note*: This repository is dedicated to my project during fall term at Bioinformatics Institute. 

### Introduction 
Maintaining balanced gut microbiota was shown to be crucial for human health. Probiotics such as *Escgerichia coli* Nissle 1917 could recover beneficial functions in gut microbial communities and prevent it from being populated with pathogenic bacteria. **LINK!!** 

Our laboratory obtained sample of *Escherichia coli* str. Nissle 1917 
In this work, we aimed to perform decontamination and de novo assembly of two sequencing samples obtained from the probiotic Mutaflor.
