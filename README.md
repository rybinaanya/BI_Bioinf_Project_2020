## Bacterial genome assembly and decontamination

*Note*: This repository describes my project performed at Bioinformatics Institute during the fall term 2020. 

### Background 
Maintaining balanced gut microbiota was shown to be crucial for human health. Probiotics such as *Escgerichia coli* Nissle 1917 could recover beneficial functions in gut microbial communities and prevent it from being populated with pathogenic bacteria. **LINK!!** 

*Escherichia coli* str. Nissle 1917 is one of common probiotics used for maintaining balanced gut microbiota. Sample of this probiotic obtained by our laboratory at drugstore occured to be contaminated. Sample inoculation resulted in producing two morphologically distinct types of colonies: of small and big size. We assumed that small colonies (referred further "Nissle Small", or simply "NS") were formed ony by *E. coli* str. Nissle 1917, while big ones ("Nissle Big", or "NB") consisted of both *E. coli* str. Nissle 1917 and some other bacteria - contaminants. 

In this work, we aimed to perform decontamination and de novo assembly of two sequencing samples obtained from the probiotic Mutaflor.
