## Bacterial genome assembly and decontamination

`Note:` This repository is dedicated to my project during fall term at Bioinformatics Institute. 

### Introduction 
Maintaining balanced gut microbiota was shown to be crucial for human health. Probiotics such as `Escgerichia coli` Nissle 1917 could recover beneficial functions in gut microbial communities and prevent it from being populated with pathogenic bacteria. LINK!! 

In this work, we aimed to perform decontamination and de novo assembly of sequencing samples obtained from the probiotic Mutaflor.
